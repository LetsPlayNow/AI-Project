  <h2>Write your own AI!</h2>
  <p>Everyone can write it's own AI. This is one of the main ideas of this site.</p>
  <p>Worldwide conducted a very interesting competition, commonly referred to as Code Game Challenge.
    Most of them are held on various programming competitions, like <%=link_to "\"ACM ICPC\"", 'http://icpc.baylor.edu/'%>.
    They consist in writing the logic of conduct for player-controlled unit that exists in the game world.</p>
  <p>Remember your favorite game.
    What if you could program the behavior of your character, and then see how it behaves under the control of your code?

    <h2>By creator</h2>

    <p>This project was created entirely by one person, who initially knew nothing about Web, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and several other web - technologies.
      This adventure gave me a lot of experience and knowledge.
      And it was a good test. It is not easy to keep calm when every unknown function turns into a huge list of nuances and causes no fewer bugs and issues.
      And you can only ask Google and StackOverflow for help.</p>
    <p>Also, the creation of this project took a long time with all my perseverance.
      I would be pleased if you <%=link_to 'support', support_project_url(lang: 'en')%> this project.
      It motivates me to improve and refine AI - Project and let me know that it's really interesting to you.</p>

    <p>If you have any suggestions or you find a bug - write about it in the form on the right of page ("Leave Feedback").</p>
    <p>I will fix errors as my time and effort. I now have very little time, because I'm getting an education.
      So if I'm late with regular fixes, do not be angry. :)</p>
