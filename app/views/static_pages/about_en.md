# Write Your own AI!
> [Русскоязычная версия этой страницы](about?lang=ru)

Everyone can write it's own AI. This is one of the main ideas of this site.  
Worldwide conducted a very interesting competition, commonly referred as [Code Game Challenge](https://habrahabr.ru/post/270953/).  
Most of them are held on various programming competitions, like [ACM ICPC](http://icpc.baylor.edu/).  
They consist in writing the logic of conduct for player-controlled unit that exists in the game world.
 
Remember your favorite game.  
What if you could program the behavior of your character,   
and then see how it behaves under the control of your code?  
Interesting, isn't it?  

On this website you can do something similar, and from anywhere, anytime.

## By creator
This project was created entirely by one person,   
who initially knew nothing about Web, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and several other web - technologies.  
This adventure gave me a lot of experience and knowledge.  
And it was a good test. It is not easy to keep calm   
when every unknown function turns into a huge list of nuances and causes no fewer bugs and issues.  
And you can only ask Google and StackOverflow for help.

Also, the creation of this project took a long time with all my perseverance.  
I will fix errors as my time and effort.  
So if I'm late with regular fixes, do not be angry. ☺
